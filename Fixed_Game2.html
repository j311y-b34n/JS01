          "You do, and break your toes. You pass out from the pain, and never wake up. Game over.",
          "You wait, and eventually fall asleep. You wake up in the same situation you were in before.",

          "You look, but it's made of solid stone. There's no way to break it. Suddenly, as you watch, it's thrown open. You can either make a run for it or wait for whatever's coming.",

Both are of a vial like yours with different plants inside, one labelled Acid, and the other labelled Unsubstantiate. You can attempt making either the Acid or Unsubstantiate. Which do you make?",

However, you do not know how to reverse the effects of the potion, and you were the origin of the myth of ghosts. Ending 1/4",

          "You skid around the corner, and then stop dead. To the left you see a button in a case that is labelled 'Free.' The other hallway has a door that has sunlight shining past it. What do you do?",
          "You lift the cover and slam your palm into the button. It emits a loud beeping noise, and with a small noise a net falls from the ceiling. The guards chasing you chuckle and put you back in your cell.",
